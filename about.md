Hi.

You've somehow reached my small blog (probably by accident).

I have no idea what this blog is about. I'm a programmer and this is connected to my Github account ... so probably tech-related stuff, but who knows? Maybe I'll decide to write about dinosaurs instead. Dinosaurs are pretty cool, although it seems like pop culture hasn't really caught up with the fact that a lot of them had colorful feathers.

If you want to get in touch, you can contact me via these methods:
